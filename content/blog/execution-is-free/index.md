We've spent decades celebrating the rise of the "knowledge economy," but let's be real—most of what's been called "knowledge work" is actually just executing known ideas. Creating slide decks, writing code, crafting reports, managing spreadsheets—these aren't groundbreaking insights; they're tasks dressed up as knowledge.

Historically, execution was costly and complicated. Imagine having a brilliant app idea five years ago. You'd need developers, designers, product managers—significant resources and capital. Many potentially transformative ideas remained unfulfilled simply because the barrier to execution was too high.

AI is rapidly dismantling those barriers. Suddenly, execution has become cheap—borderline free. You don't need a development team; you just prompt. Coding, graphic design, content creation—tasks previously requiring specialized talent and substantial budgets—can now be done in moments, by anyone.

We've seen this pattern before, notably in the art world. The early 20th century saw movements like Dadaism and Surrealism reject traditional artistic execution in favor of radical conceptual innovation. Marcel Duchamp didn't painstakingly sculpt his way to fame; he famously placed a urinal in a gallery and titled it "Fountain," challenging perceptions of art itself. René Magritte's brilliance wasn't in meticulous realism, but in thought-provoking juxtapositions that questioned reality. These artists proved that ideas—bold, original, provocative—were more impactful than mere technical execution.

Today, we're experiencing a similar shift—but at an unprecedented scale. With AI making execution trivial, the premium is shifting decisively towards those who can conceive compelling and novel ideas. We're entering an era akin to the modern art revolution, where creativity isn't hindered by the traditional limitations of practical execution.

The implications are enormous. Barriers collapse. The playing field levels. Innovation accelerates. Creativity, no longer constrained by practical limits, is unleashed.

Simply put: Now you can just do things.
