Welcome to my "Now" page ðŸ‘‹

{{< toc mobile_only=true is_open=true >}}

## Current Focus

I'm currently working on stuff.

## Why a "Now" Page?

A "Now" page is a snapshot of my current professional focus and interests. Unlike social media updates or blog posts that can get buried in feeds, this page stays in one place and is regularly updated.

Key benefits:
1. It helps me clarify my priorities and commitments
2. It provides an easy way for colleagues and friends to see what I'm up to
3. It creates a record of my professional journey over time

## Recent Updates

- **July 2024**: Initial creation of Now page
