I'm excited to announce that our research team has had **three papers** accepted at the **5th ACM International Conference on AI in Finance (ICAIF 2024)**!

## The Papers

1. **The Effect of Liquidity on the Spoofability of Financial Markets**  
   *Anri Gu, Yongzhao Wang, Chris Mascioli, Mithun Chakraborty, Rahul Savani, Theodore L Turocy, Michael P Wellman*  
   
   This study investigates how market liquidity affects the vulnerability of financial markets to spoofing attacks - a form of market manipulation where traders place orders they intend to cancel to mislead other market participants.

2. **Market Making with Learned Beta Policies**  
   *Yongzhao Wang, Rahul Savani, Anri Gu, Chris Mascioli, Theodore Turocy, Michael Wellman*  
   
   In this paper, we introduce a general adaptive market maker based on beta policies by employing deep reinforcement learning to dynamically control the scaled beta distribution parameters and generate orders based on current market conditions.

3. **A Financial Market Simulation Environment for Trading Agents Using Deep Reinforcement Learning**  
   *Chris Mascioli, Anri Gu, Yongzhao Wang, Mithun Chakraborty, Michael Wellman*  
   
   We present PyMarketSim, a financial market simulation environment designed for training and evaluating trading agents using deep reinforcement learning, incorporating key elements such as private valuations, asymmetric information, and a flexible limit order book mechanism.

## About ICAIF

The ACM International Conference on AI in Finance (ICAIF) brings together researchers from AI and finance to share advances in the application of AI in financial services and discuss the unique challenges of the domain. ICAIF 2024 will be the fifth iteration of this prestigious conference.

I'm looking forward to presenting our work and engaging with the AI in finance community at the conference!
